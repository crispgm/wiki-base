# God Defend New Zealand

E Ihowā Atua,  
O ngā iwi mātou rā  
Āta whakarangona;  
Me aroha noa  
Kia hua ko te pai;  
Kia tau tō atawhai;  
Manaakitia mai  
Aotearoa

God of Nations at Thy feet,  
In the bonds of love we meet,  
Hear our voices, we entreat,  
God defend our free land.  
Guard Pacific's triple star  
From the shafts of strife and war,  
Make her praises heard afar,  
God defend New Zealand.
