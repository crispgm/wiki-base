Many people of European heritage in South Africa are descended from Huguenots. Most of these originally settled in the Cape Colony, but were absorbed into the Afrikaner and Afrikaans-speaking population, because they had religious similarities to the Dutch colonists. See [Huguenots in South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots_in_South_Africa).
